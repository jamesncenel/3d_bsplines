# 3d_bsplines
Here's a Matheamtica notebook that creates connected 3D bsplines. You need Wolfram Mathematica to run this and see its output. Open the notebook there, and then run it by entering shift + enter within each code block.

Note: You can only have one notebook open at a time in Mathematica. If you have more than one open at once, it may cause errors when executing any of them.
